# Xecuter3.1

Xecuter 3 PCB with 5V control onboard for V1.6 (Universal 1.0 - 1.6)
Manually routed, every trace, in Eagle for best optimisation by myself. Smaller size, slightly smaller than purple X3.

Supports the original Xecuter 3 parts transferred from a damaged X3 pcb (LC4128V CPLD) and also LC4256V CPLD or LC4128V CPLD with open source vhdl's.

AM29F016D and AM29F016B can be used for main flash (same ID code).
AM29F002BB and AM29F002NBT can be used for the Backup 256k chip with open source code. The original X3 backup chip was an EON EN29F002ANT, generally unavailable in TSOP32 package.
